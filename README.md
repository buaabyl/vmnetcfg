vmnetcfg
========

The open source version is host on [https://github.com/buaabyl/openvmnetcfg]

This project is unoffical archive of vmware net config,
because googlecode stop download, I copy to github [https://github.com/buaabyl/vmnetcfg]. so https://code.google.com/p/vmnetcfg/ will not maintain.

From VMware Player 12.x, major version is same as worksataion.

~~From VMware Player 7.0, only support 64bits Host!
But I upgrade from vmware player 6.0 to vmware player 12.0,
so it is missing vmnetcfg for VMware Player 7.x~~

Thanks @github/RobbiNespu the missing version is archive:)
