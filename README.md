vmnetcfg
========




The open source version is host on [https://github.com/buaabyl/openvmnetcfg]

This project is unoffical archive of vmware net config,
because googlecode stop download, I copy to github [https://github.com/buaabyl/vmnetcfg]. so https://code.google.com/p/vmnetcfg/ will not maintain.

-----
Tips: From VMware 15.x, VIX is not standalone:(

-----
Tips: From VMware Player 12.x, major version is same as worksataion.

Thanks @RobbiNespu the missing version is archive:)
